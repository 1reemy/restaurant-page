# Sizzla Restaurant, Restaurant-Page
This is a fictional restaurant website page, created using javascript and webpack. The Restaurant page is called Sizzla Restaurant and it links to an actual company website
for GHC Foods Ltd, which manufactures and distirbutes Sizzla Seasoning and Spices which is a Jamaican brand. The website consists of four(4) pages 
a Landing Page (Home Page), an About Page, a Menu Page and A Contact Page. These pages are all accessible by the user and allows the user to browse through the pages
and click on the links available. The contact information is for the GHC Foods Seasoning and Spices Company and users are free to make contact with the company and 
make purchases if interested. 

In creating this website using webpack, I have learnt how versatile webpack can be and how much faster it is to create web pages using modules that can be reused instead
hardcoding a website from scratch. This has motivated me to learn other Frontend Webdevelopment Technologies.
